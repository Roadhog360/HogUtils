# HogUtils
Shared library for Roadhog360's mods that is hopefully also useful to other people!
Aims to provide powerful and useful utilities to developers, as well as players, hopefully making it useful even standalone.

Features are added as I need/want them, but requests will still be listened to.

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION
This library is not finished. The API is highly unstable and constantly changing as I figure out what I want to do, and how I want to do it. While this mod is probably stable enough to be installed into an instance, it's currently not recommended to do so beyond testing, because only experimental builds of Et Futurum Requiem require this, and the so-called "player utilities" I mention before are largely incomplete.

If you plan to depend on HogUtils this early on, please keep this in mind.

# NO ETA
There is currently no ETA as to when this will be on a maven or when it will be finished. I have little time or energy to focus on Minecraft modding due to factors largely outside of my own control.
