# HogUtils
Shared library for Roadhog360's mods that is hopefully also useful to other people!

## DISCLAIMER
This library is not finished. The API should not be considered stable and is subject to changes. While it's ready for standalone use or for use with Roadhog360's mods, its API is not ready for use by other mods at this time. Thus, the API could change at any moment and break your mod if you use the API. These versions will be marked as 0.x.x releases. When I consider the API ready for use, 1.x.x versions will start showing up and will be available on Modrinth.

For players: While documentation is incomplete and CraftTweaker support is not yet implemented, the mod is considered safe to install now. However it is good practice to keep backups of your world in case anything major has gone unnoticed.
